# NumPyArrayOperations

This project demonstrates the key features of the NumPy library, which is widely used in the field of Data Science for numerical computations and data manipulation. NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant, and it was built to handle large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It serves as the foundation for many data processing and scientific computing libraries in Python, including SciPy, Pandas, and more.

NumPy offers a comprehensive suite for working with linear algebra, random number generation, and Fourier transforms, making it indispensable for scientific and numerical programming.

## Conda (Setup and Environment)

To make the project reproducible and ensure smooth package management, this project uses Conda as a package and environment manager. Below are the steps to set up the environment:


1. **Install Conda**:
If you haven't installed Conda yet, you can download it from the official [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) websites. Anaconda is a larger distribution with more pre-installed packages, while Miniconda is a smaller, minimal version. Choose whichever suits your needs.

2. **Create a new environment**
Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Conda environment with Python 3.10:

    ```bash
    conda create --name new_conda_env python=3.12
    ```

3. **Activate the environment**
Once the environment is created, activate it by running:

    ```bash
    conda activate new_conda_env
    ```

4. **Install required packages (Jupyter and NumPy)**

    ```bash
    conda install jupyter numpy
    ```

5. **Run Jupyter Notebook**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
